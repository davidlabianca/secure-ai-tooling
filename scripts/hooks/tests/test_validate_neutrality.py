Tests for scripts/hooks/precommit/validate_neutrality.py (does not exist yet — TDD red phase).

ADR-033 D2a/D5 establish a "vendor-neutral shipping" contract for the two
authoring surfaces that ship in this repository: `scripts/agents/**` and
`scripts/skills/**`. Prose in those trees must not name a specific AI harness
product, company, CLI entry point, or model identifier; must not embed
harness-invocation stage directions (`<invoke ... tool>`, `subagent_type`,
"auto-loads"/"auto-triggers"); and must not reference harness-specific config
paths (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, etc.). Framework-authority references (MITRE,
NIST, OWASP, ISO, EU AI Act, STRIDE) are legitimate content and must never be
flagged, even adjacent to real denylist hits.

A distinct structural rule governs YAML frontmatter: a `SKILL.md` file may
only declare `name`/`description` in its frontmatter; an agent `.md` file
(ADR-006 prose form, ordinarily frontmatter-free) must not declare a runtime-
binding key (`tools`, `model`, `color`, `allowed-tools`/`allowed_tools`) if it
happens to have a frontmatter block at all.

Public API under test (scripts/hooks/precommit/validate_neutrality.py):
    - `HOOK_NAME = "validate-neutrality"`
    - `Violation` frozen dataclass: `path`, `line`, `token`, `message`.
      `token` carries the matched offending snippet (e.g. "Claude Code",
      ".cursor/", "subagent_type") so a maintainer can grep for it.
    - `validate_file(path: Path) -> list[Violation]` — denylist scan (with
      allowlist suppression) plus frontmatter-key checks for one file.
      Returns `[]` (not `None`) when clean.
    - `discover_neutral_surface_files(root: Path) -> list[Path]` — files
      under `root/scripts/agents/**` and `root/scripts/skills/**` only.
    - `format_violation(violation: Violation) -> str` — stderr line,
      `<hook_name>: <file>:<line>: <message>`.
    - `main(argv: list[str]) -> int` — CLI entry point; explicit file args or
      self-discovery; returns 1 if any violations, else 0.

`scripts/hooks/precommit/_neutrality_data.py` is the sanctioned place vendor
tokens legitimately appear as detection data. Its exact export names are not
locked by this test file (see the single regression-guard test in
`TestFrameworkAllowlist`); behavioral coverage goes through `validate_neutrality`.

CRLF line-ending handling IS covered and locked (see `TestDocumentedGapsAndLockins`
E12): `splitlines()` plus `strip()`/YAML tolerate the trailing CR, so both the
frontmatter forbidden-key check and the body denylist scan fire correctly on
CRLF files. (An earlier revision of this suite declared CRLF out of scope; the
neutrality-hardening pass verified it is handled and locked it instead.)

Out of scope for this suite (documented so it doesn't read as an oversight):
frontmatter *required*-field validation (name/description presence). The
frontmatter tests here only enforce the ceiling — no extra/binding keys, and
fail-closed on unverifiable frontmatter — not the floor — required keys
present — which is deferred to a later phase that reconciles against the Agent
Skills reference validator.

    """
    PR #428 review Finding 3: a shared text/binary policy between discovery
    and validate_file.

    Two current defects:
      (a) `validate_file` has no binary-vs-text distinction at all: it always
          attempts `path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")` and, on failure, always
          emits a "not valid UTF-8" violation — even for a file whose
          extension isn't textual at all (e.g. a bundled `assets/icon.png`).
          A binary asset should be silently skipped (`[]`), not flagged.
      (b)/(c)/(d) `discover_neutral_surface_files` only enumerates
          `_DISCOVERABLE_TEXT_EXTENSIONS = {.md, .py, .yaml, .yml, .json,
          .txt}`, silently skipping the plan's full textual-extension set —
          `.sh`/`.js`/`.ts`/`.toml` — bundled with a skill, so a denylisted
          term in a bundled setup script or config is invisible to the hook
          via self-discovery. The discovery-inclusion test below is
          parametrized over all four so a partial fix (e.g. only `.sh`/
          `.toml`) does not silently pass.

    LB1 preservation (critical constraint, must NOT regress): a **known-text**
    file (a `.md`) with invalid UTF-8 bytes — including one whose bytes
    contain a NUL, the exact shape `test_main_self_discovery_does_not_raise_
    on_invalid_utf8` in TestFailClosedNonUtf8 exercises — must still be
    flagged, not skipped. A naive "NUL byte anywhere ⇒ binary ⇒ skip" rule

    being a known text extension.

Test Summary
============
Total Tests: 152 (counting parametrize expansion)

Original suite (74), unchanged except the TestScopeBoundaries/TestLiveCorpus
moves noted below:
- TestDenylistVendorProductNames: 19
- TestDenylistHarnessInvocationTokens: 10
- TestDenylistHarnessConfigPaths: 8
- TestFrameworkAllowlist: 8
- TestScopeBoundaries: 4 — gained `test_absent_skills_subtree_contributes_
  nothing_without_erroring`, moved in from TestLiveCorpus (see below).
- TestFrontmatterRulesSkill: 6
- TestFrontmatterRulesAgent: 7
- TestCli: 6
- TestLiveCorpus: 2 — UPDATED twice. First: the corpus is now fully clean.
  architect.md's self-referential vendor mentions were scrubbed on this branch
  (commit c774caf), so `test_architect_md_is_now_clean` and
  `test_no_leakage_anywhere_in_discovered_corpus` lock a clean corpus rather
  than the former "architect.md is the one flagged file" assumption, which is
  stale and would fight the ADR-033 gate requirement that every canonical
  artifact exit 0. Second: `test_skills_directory_does_not_exist_yet_and_
  contributes_nothing` was a landmine — it asserted the REAL repo's
  scripts/skills/ was absent, which passes only until a real skill lands (it
  is confirmed failing on the phase1/phase2 branches once
  scripts/skills/classical-lexicon/ exists). Moved to TestScopeBoundaries as a
  tmp_path-based synthetic-tree test that does not depend on live repo state,
  and the class docstring corrected to stop claiming scripts/skills/ "must
  contribute zero discovered files" as a live-corpus fact.
- TestAdversarialEdgeCases: 4

Neutrality-hardening additions (59), from the ADR-033 D2a fail-open audit plus
a code-review follow-up round that closed two residual fail-open/false-positive
gaps in the first hardening pass:
- TestFailClosedNonUtf8: 2 (LB1) — invalid-UTF-8 file flagged not raised;
  main([]) self-discovery does not crash on it.
- TestFailClosedMalformedFrontmatter: 10 (LB2) — unquoted-colon, tab-indent,
  list/scalar non-mapping, missing-closing-fence (SKILL + agent),
  forbidden-key-after-second-fence all fail closed on structurally-expected
  files; a references/*.md opening with a `---` thematic break is NOT flagged
  (false-positive guard). Review follow-up: a nested references/SKILL.md
  (same filename, NOT the canonical skill root) is exempt from BOTH the
  malformed-frontmatter fail-closed checks AND the skill name/description
  allowlist itself, while the canonical skill-root SKILL.md remains fully
  structural.
- TestFailClosedFrontmatterKeyCase: 6 (LB3) — capitalized binding keys
  (Model/Tools/Color/Allowed-Tools/Allowed_Tools) with neutral values are
  flagged on agent defs; capitalized Tools on SKILL.md is flagged.
- TestDenylistBroadenings: 19 (Tier 3) — E1 lowercase vendors
  (openai/anthropic/copilot/chatgpt/codeium) + CLAUDE.md non-regression;
  E3 extra CLI entrypoints (cursor/aider/windsurf/codex/cline) + claude
  non-regression; E6 auto-load paraphrases (-loading/-activates/-invokes/bare
  auto-load); E8 IGNORECASE config paths (.Claude/, .github/Copilot) + .vscode/
  negative lock.
- TestDocumentedGapsAndLockins: 22 (Tier 2 + review follow-up) — E2 unlisted
  model families, E9 unknown vendors, E4 wrapped-line split, E7 subagent
  spacing variants are DOCUMENTED GAPS of the maintained denylist; E5
  code-fence/HTML-comment vendor IS flagged (no exemption), E10
  symlink-followed / dir-named-*.md-excluded, E11 empty-file-clean /
  no-extension-excluded, E12 CRLF frontmatter-key + body-vendor handled are
  LOCKS. Review follow-up (E10): a dangling symlink is now DISCOVERED and
  FLAGGED, not merely non-crashing — `discover_neutral_surface_files` checks
  `is_symlink()` independently of `is_file()` (which follows a symlink and
  returns False for a broken one), and `main()` no longer `continue`s past a
  path that fails `exists()` but is a symlink, so a broken link reaches
  `validate_file`'s OSError guard instead of being filtered out upstream of it.

PR #428 review red-phase additions (19), for the three implementation
findings raised in review (treatment plan:
working-plans/pr-428-review-treatment-plan.md). None of these are
implemented yet on this branch; they specify the fixes and are expected RED
until the SWE step lands them:
- TestFalsyFrontmatterFinding1: 5 (Finding 1) — `false`/`0`/`[]` frontmatter on
  a canonical SKILL.md must be flagged as unverifiable (RED: `yaml.safe_load(
  ...) or {}` currently coerces each to `{}`); an empty block (`---\n---`) and
  a whitespace-only block both parse to `None` and must stay clean (GREEN,
  negative lock — these are not part of the fail-open gap).
- TestTextBinaryPolicyFinding3: 14 (Finding 3) — shared text/binary policy
  between discover_neutral_surface_files and validate_file. A bundled binary
  asset (PNG header + NUL bytes) must be skipped ([], not flagged, no raise)
  by validate_file directly and via main() (RED, 2 tests: today any
  UnicodeDecodeError is unconditionally flagged regardless of extension).
  Bundled .sh/.js/.toml files with a denylisted term are flagged, and clean
  .sh/.toml are clean, when validate_file is called directly (GREEN today —
  validate_file has no extension gate on the scanning side). Discovery is
  parametrized over the plan's full extension set (.sh/.js/.ts/.toml, 4
  cases) and must include a bundled file of each under scripts/skills/** (RED:
  `_DISCOVERABLE_TEXT_EXTENSIONS` has none of these today); a binary asset
  must stay excluded from discovery (GREEN, already true — .png was never in
  the text-extension set and must not become one). LB1 preservation
  (re-affirmed, not weakened): a known-text .md with invalid UTF-8 (including
  NUL bytes) must still fail closed via both validate_file directly and
  main([]) self-discovery (GREEN, 2 tests) — any fix must gate binary-skip on
  the extension not being known-text, not merely on NUL-byte presence.

A companion structural-drift suite for Finding 2 (policy-data/validator-logic
edits must re-trigger a full corpus re-scan) lives in a separate file,
scripts/hooks/tests/test_precommit_neutrality_config.py, since it parses
.pre-commit-config.yaml rather than exercising validate_neutrality.py
directly — see that file's module docstring for its own RED/GREEN breakdown.

Coverage Areas:
- ADR-033 denylist categories: vendor/product/company/CLI names (incl. lowercase
  leakage), model-identifier patterns, harness-invocation tokens, subagent_type,
  auto-loads/auto-triggers (+ paraphrases), harness config paths (case-insensitive)
- ADR-033 framework-authority allowlist: MITRE/ATLAS, NIST/AI RMF, OWASP/Top 10,
  ISO, EU AI Act, STRIDE — per-match (not per-line) suppression
- ADR-033 scope boundaries: scripts/agents/**, scripts/skills/** only;
  scripts/hooks/** never scanned
- ADR-033 frontmatter structural rules, fail-closed on unverifiable input,
  scoped to the canonical skill-root SKILL.md + top-level agent defs
  (reference material — including a same-named nested SKILL.md — exempt)
- Fail-closed robustness: non-UTF-8, malformed/unterminated/non-mapping
  frontmatter, and dangling symlinks are all discovered and flagged, never
  silently dropped and never crashing the gate
- CLI contract: explicit args, self-discovery, exit codes, stderr format
- Live-corpus regression: the whole scripts/agents/ corpus is clean
