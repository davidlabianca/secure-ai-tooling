"""
Pre-commit lint: enforce ADR-033 D2a/D5 vendor-neutrality for shipped surfaces.

`scripts/agents/**` and `scripts/skills/**` are the two authoring surfaces
that ship in this repository. Prose in those trees must not name a specific
AI harness product, company, CLI entry point, or model identifier; must not
embed harness-invocation stage directions (`<invoke ... tool>`,
`subagent_type`, "auto-loads"/"auto-triggers"); and must not reference
harness-specific config paths (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, etc.). Framework-
authority references (MITRE, NIST, OWASP, ISO, EU AI Act, STRIDE) are
legitimate content and are allowlisted by span, so a denylist hit is only
suppressed where it actually overlaps an allowlist match on the same line —
not for the whole line.

A separate structural rule governs YAML frontmatter: the canonical skill-root
`SKILL.md` (`scripts/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) may declare only
`name`/`description`; a top-level agent `.md` (directly under
`scripts/agents/`) must not declare a runtime-binding key (`tools`, `model`,
`color`, `allowed-tools`/`allowed_tools`) if it happens to carry a frontmatter
block at all. Frontmatter that cannot be verified (malformed YAML, an
unterminated fence) is a violation on those two structural targets, fail
closed rather than silently skipped; a same-named or bundled file that is not
one of those two structural targets (e.g. `references/SKILL.md`,
`references/*.md`) is exempt from this structural rule and only gets the
denylist scan.

`scripts/hooks/precommit/_neutrality_data.py` holds the denylist/allowlist
patterns; this module only implements the scan and CLI.
