    The following personas identify who is impacted by
    <a href="risks.html">risks</a> and who is responsible for enacting the
    <a href="controls.html">controls</a> that mitigate them, based on their
    activities and responsibilities in the AI ecosystem.
  - >
    CoSAI identifies seven standard personas representing distinct sets of
    activities across AI system development, deployment, and governance.
    Legacy personas from earlier versions are retained for backward
    compatibility but marked as deprecated.

  - id: personaModelProvider
    title: Model Provider
    description:
      - >
        Actors that develop, train, evaluate, and tune AI/ML models
        (foundation models, specialized models, or domain-adapted models).
        This includes those that develop models from scratch or significantly
        modify existing models for distribution.

    title: Data Provider
    description:
      - >

        or inference data to model providers or application developers. This includes
        data aggregators, data marketplaces, and those licensing datasets.
    mappings:
      iso-22989:
        - AI Partner (data supplier)
    responsibilities:
      - Data quality assurance
      - Data provenance tracking
      - Data licensing and compliance
      - Data privacy protections

  - id: personaPlatformProvider
    title: AI Platform Provider
    description:
      - >
        Actors that provide infrastructure, compute resources, APIs, and
        platform services for AI model hosting, training, or inference. This includes
        internal infrastructure teams, cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), MLOps
        platforms, and model API services.
    mappings:
      iso-22989:
        - AI Partner (infrastructure provider)
    responsibilities:
      - Infrastructure security and availability
      - API security and rate limiting
      - Compute resource allocation
      - Model hosting and serving

  - id: personaAgenticProvider
    title: Agentic Platform and Framework Providers
    description:
      - >
        Actors that provide the development environments,
        software frameworks, and orchestration runtimes required to implement
        agentic reasoning, planning, and tool execution.
      - >
        Examples include agentic frameworks and libraries (e.g., LangChain,
        Semantic Kernel), agent-native development environments (e.g., Cursor,
        GitHub Copilot Workspace), and managed agent orchestration platforms
        (e.g., Vertex AI Agent Builder, OpenAI Assistants API).
    mappings:
      iso-22989:
        - AI Partner (tooling provider)
    responsibilities:
      - Framework security and sandboxing
      - Tool execution safety controls
      - State management security
      - API integration security
      - Cognitive architecture safety guardrails
    identificationQuestions:
      - Is your system responsible for deciding which tool an AI model should use next?
      - Does your platform manage the state or history of a multi-turn agentic workflow?
      - Are you providing the glue that connects an LLM to an API?
      - Are you maintaining a library or SDK that abstracts the complexity of LLM tool-calling?
      - Does your software define the cognitive architecture (loops, reasoning steps) for an AI system?
      - Do developers import your package to enable agentic capabilities in their code?

  - id: personaApplicationDeveloper
    title: Application Developer
    description:
      - >
        Actors that integrate AI models (via APIs or embedded models) into
        applications, products, or services. They may consume models without
        modifying them, or perform light customization (prompt engineering, RAG, etc.).
    mappings:
      iso-22989:
        - AI Consumer (application builder)
    responsibilities:
      - Application-level security controls
      - Input validation and sanitization
      - Output filtering and monitoring
      - User access controls

  - id: personaGovernance
    title: AI System Governance
    description:
      - >
        Actors responsible for defining security control objectives,
        measuring implementations, and enforcing compliance for AI systems across
        the AI system lifecycle. This includes AI risk officers, compliance teams,
        and governance boards.
    responsibilities:
      - Security control objectives definition
      - Implementation measurement and monitoring
      - Compliance enforcement
      - Risk assessment and management
      - Incident response coordination

  - id: personaEndUser
    title: AI System Users
    description:
      - >
        Actors that use AI-powered applications or services
        without developing or deploying the AI components themselves. Users
        rely on application developers and providers for AI security controls.
    mappings:
      iso-22989:
        - AI Consumer (end user)
    responsibilities:
      - Appropriate use of AI systems
      - Reporting issues or anomalies
      - Following usage policies
      - Data minimization (user inputs)

        Application Developer for those integrating models into applications.
      - >
        Organizations that either train and tune foundation models for Generative AI,
        or tune acquired models for more domain-specific tasks.
    deprecated: true

  - id: personaModelConsumer
    title: Model Consumer (Legacy)
    description:
      - >
        DEPRECATED: Use Application Developer or AI System Users depending on context.
      - >

        but do not create or tune the models themselves. The models may be accessed
        via an API to a managed service, or downloaded and packaged into the application
        or product being produced.
