# External Security Frameworks
#
# Framework IDs (keys) must match the id field within each framework definition
# Framework IDs must be included in the enum in frameworks.schema.json
#
# NOTE: Quotes are required on `version` and `lastUpdated` fields to prevent
# YAML type coercion (e.g., '2025' would become integer 2025, '1.0' would
# become float 1.0, and dates like '2025-10-15' may be parsed as date objects).
