    The following sections describe controls available to organizations for specific
    AI risks.

    Each control is mapped onto the corresponding risks it can address, with the exception
    of Governance and Assurance controls, which apply universally to all risks and
    every stage of the AI development process.

        actions it is allowed to take. An agentic system’s use of privileges should be 
        contextual and dynamic, adapting to the specific user query and trusted contextual 
        information. This design also applies to agents that have access to user 
        information. For example, an agent asked to fill out a form or answer questions 
        should share only contextually appropriate information and can be designed to 
        dynamically minimize exposed data using reference monitors.
