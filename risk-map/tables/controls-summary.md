| controlAgentPluginPermissions                       | Agent Permissions                                 | Use least-privilege principle as the upper bound on agentic system permissions to  minimize the number of tools that an agent is permitted to interact with and the  actions it is allowed to take. An agentic system’s use of privileges should be  contextual and dynamic, adapting to the specific user query and trusted contextual  information. This design also applies to agents that have access to user  information. For example, an agent asked to fill out a form or answer questions  should share only contextually appropriate information and can be designed to  dynamically minimize exposed data using reference monitors.<br> | controlsApplication    |
